optional chaining not working in my code
?. expression

student page - layout component - its state only works in this page
overview page - layout component - its state only works in this page
state of layout component is reset after redirect to a new page, did not keep the state stored in previous page
potential solution: 1. store the state into session or local storage

# lec 10

difference between these 2
setState(state+1)
setState(prevState=>prevState+1)

### Lec 10 todo:

1. what css property will be inherited
2. usecallback done
3. position

# Lec 11

1. if setState is called at the top of code block,
   will the rest of code be executed in current render
2. if parent element is not specified with any value in height,
   what will happen when setting child's height to 30%
